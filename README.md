# The Mill @ PlainOpen

This is the code for the blog at https://mill.plainopen.com/. It is the _generated_ code.
If you are interested in the content, read the blog instead.

This repository also holds [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dsagal/plainopen-mill-blog/discussions)
that power the comments under the blog posts,
via [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus), which is pretty neat.
